community_thoughts:
    - “This is fascinating from a historical perspective, but the music isn't something I'd want to listen to repeatedly. I don't know what I'd have thought if I'd heard this back in 1965, but in 2018, it sounds primitive, like a high school band who wrote a few songs and are messing around with them. It's hard to believe that these kids evolved into the amazing entity we know as The Grateful Dead.” – hitmeister, archive.org
    - “What's great about this set is that it is almost pre-Dead Grateful Dead. The sound they developed in the 1970s and 1980s isn't there. Instead were hear some stuff that's derivative of Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues" in ‘Can't Come Down,’ and a definite mid-1960s San Francisco psychedelic sound in ‘Mindbender.’” – AndrewMCM, archive.org
    - “verrrrrry nice” – grateful247, archive.org
    - “this is beeeyyyyyond belief! i can't remember how i found the archive, though i'm certain that god led me here. i was always sort of a brit-psychedelia fan before i started getting into the SF bands, so this is just a peppermint-candy french horn blowing dark star rainbows down my very spine!!! dig everything! dig it!”– lemon lime partridge, archive.org 
    - “I agree that this is an interesting artifact of the pre-acid Dead. As such I give it five stars. To me it sounds like they had just been to a Byrds concert and were attempting to do their own version of that sound. Would love similar early accounts of other SF bands in their embryonic stage, esp. Airplane with Skip Spence, QMS, and Big Brother before Janis joined them. Its ok to dream isn't it?” – asabajin, archive.org 
    - “Wow - I'm shocked by this recording! Who is this psychedelic folk-pop band?! Can't believe they ever sounded like this, and I'm so grateful for the listen. Five stars for sheer archival value.” – AlligatorWine, archive.org
    - “what a wonderful, wistful, windy passage back to sun dappled eucalyptus scented days- please check this out w/ the acid tests... if enough of us listen maybe we can build a ship and go back there...maybe we're there now... glorious, essential stuff- the root of our great tree...” – oceantree, archive.org

## INTRO

Woah, partner, it’s 1965 and we’ve got just the Grateful Dead* tape for you!

*So the context here is the band’s name is actually the Emergency Crew, neé the Warlocks and not quite yet the Grateful Dead. The Emergency Crew, called this for one night and one night only, are demoing their stuff for Autumn Records at Golden State Studios in San Francisco. 

It’s not a live show, nor is anything here going to transport you to another psychic plane and make you drop your jaw in awe and maybe even tear up a little—that’s for later. For now, this is the complimentary miso soup of Grateful Dead recordings...a little something before the main course to get you in the mood. 

And a little bonus history, because, like I said, partner, it’s 1965... 

If you’d like a bit of context for the social and cultural scene in San Francisco when the Dead were coming up, check out [Hunter S. Thompson for the New York Times on the “Hashbury."](https://londonflowscreedinfo.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/the-hashbury-is-the-capital-of-the-hippies-hst-1967-2/)

Then, if you’d like to read up on the San Francisco sound and learn more about some of the other music-makers in the Bay Area at the time, read [this low-fi but informative page](https://www.shsu.edu/~lis_fwh/book/regional_styles/San%20Francisco%20Sound2.htm) from Sam Houston State University’s website and the [requisite Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_sound).

## THE SHOW

**“Can’t Come Down”** sounds a heck of a lot like a couple of kids trying to emulate Bob Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues” and a little bit of 60’s Rolling Stones, which they covered as a bar band. And rhyming streets / sheets / feet / treats / me / eat / sweet...at / that / cat / bat / flat / fat / hat...grip / slip / trip / ship / sip / flip / nip...sees / trees / seas / me’s / freeze / ease / fees...hints of Dr. Seuss in Jerry’s rap. It’s fun! This one was only played once or twice live, so enjoy it here.

**“Mindbender”** is a trippy little number with a great baseline and fun keyboard. Also only played a few times. They practiced the lyrics they preached with this one. Haha, LSD! Also, I’m kind of getting the James Bond theme. Anyone else?

**“The Only Time Is Now,”** like the two songs before, is also totally different from the band they turned into. Kind of a chill vibe with the delay on the guitar, really going for the harmonies which you gotta respect. A little pop tune! 

A great early version of **“Caution (Do Not Stop On The Tracks)”** with a killer baseline and harmonica to boot—especially hot intro, a little gratuitous but I’m not complaining. Makes you wanna dance. Hot, hot, hot!

This **“I Know You Rider”** makes me smile. Simple and toned-down, but still hot...almost sounds like the Beatles on Rubber Soul. Maybe I’m wrong? I’m not a music critic! That was released just a month after this recording. Anyway, of course, the song evolved as they explored it, but this is a hell of a place to start. While it’s not preceded by a **“China Cat Sunflower,”** there is a mention of the Cheshire Cat in **“Mindbender”** so...the more things change, the more they stay the same.

I think it’s a shame **“Early Morning Rain”** didn’t stay in their rotation longer, because this is a real beautiful tune with potential for jams... Still, beautiful to see the band taking a folk song and making it their own.
